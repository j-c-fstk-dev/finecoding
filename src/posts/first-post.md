## A New Beginning

Welcome! This blog has been refactored to use a fully static architecture. Instead of fetching posts from a database at runtime, all content is now stored in local Markdown files right inside the project repository.

### Why the Change?

- **Reliability:** The build process is no longer dependent on external services like a database. This completely eliminates the build errors we were facing.
- **Performance:** Serving static HTML files is incredibly fast.
- **Simplicity:** Content is managed directly through git, which aligns well with a developer-focused workflow.

This approach makes the site robust, fast, and easy to deploy on services like GitHub Pages.
